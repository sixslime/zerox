This project's goal is to digitally recreate [401 Infinite](https://github.com/rtaylor034/401-infinite-paper).

In specific, this project is planned to include the following:
* A DSL, **"FZO"**, that defines game logic.
* Interfaces that model, but do not implement, the **FZO** runtime.
* A minimal implementation of the **FZO** runtime.
* A testing framework for programs written in **FZO**.
* An implementation of [401 Infinite](https://github.com/rtaylor034/401-infinite-paper) written in **FZO**.
