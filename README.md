> Heavy work in progress! Will eventually be split into seperate repositories. Currently just a collection of libraries and tests; no entrypoint.

This project's goal is to digitally recreate [401 Infinite](https://github.com/rtaylor034/401-infinite-paper).

In specific, this project is planned to include the following:
* A (quasi) domain specific language, **"FZO"**, that can define game logic.
* An interface (implemented externally) of **FZO**'s runtime.
* A minimal implementation of the **FZO** runtime.
* A testing framework for programs written in **FZO**.
* An implementation of [401 Infinite](https://github.com/rtaylor034/401-infinite-paper) written in **FZO**.
